# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic **Snake** game using HTML5 canvas and vanilla JavaScript. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat the red apples without colliding into walls or itself. With each apple eaten, the snake grows longer and the player's score increases.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository, then open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the **arrow keys** on your keyboard to control the snake's movement (up, down, left, right).
3. Guide the snake to eat the red apple on the canvas. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer and the score increases.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body. If a collision occurs, the game is over and you can start again by pressing **OK** in the alert dialog.

## Game Features

- **Responsive gameplay** with a 20×20 grid.
- **Score tracking** displayed below the canvas.
- **Dynamic apple placement** that ensures the apple never spawns on the snake's body.
- **Simple and lightweight**: no external frameworks or libraries required.
